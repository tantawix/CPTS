The `-h` flag specifies the target host. The `-Tuning b` flag tells `Nikto` to only run the Software Identification modules.

**The reconnaissance scan on `inlanefreight.com` reveals several key findings:**

- `IPs`: The website resolves to both IPv4 (`134.209.24.248`) and IPv6 (`2a03:b0c0:1:e0::32c:b001`) addresses.
- `Server Technology`: The website runs on `Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)`
- `WordPress Presence`: The scan identified a WordPress installation, including the login page (`/wp-login.php`). This suggests the site might be a potential target for common WordPress-related exploits.
- `Information Disclosure`: The presence of a `license.txt` file could reveal additional details about the website's software components.
- `Headers`: Several non-standard or insecure headers were found, including a missing `Strict-Transport-Security` header and a potentially insecure `x-redirect-by` header.
