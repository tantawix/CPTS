- **Enumeration** is stands for information gathering using acive and passive methods
- **OSINT** is an independent procedureand should be performed separately from enumeration
- **OSINT** is based exclusively on passive information gathering
- ممكن اجمع المعلومات من الdomains بتاعت التارجت او من خلال الIPs او من الaccessible services

## Enumeration Methodology
The whole enumeration process is divided into three different levels:

| `Infrastructure-based enumeration` | `Host-based enumeration` | `OS-based enumeration` |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
### Layer No.1: Internet Presence

- in this layer, we use different techniques to find domains, subdomains, netblocks, and many other components and information that present the presence of the company and its infrastructure on the Internet
- The goal of this layer is to identify all possible target systems and interfaces that can be tested
### Layer No.2: Gateway

- The goal is to understand what we are dealing with and what we have to watch out for.
### Layer No.3: Accessible Services

- This layer aims to understand the reason and functionality of the target system and gain the necessary knowledge to communicate with it and exploit it for our purposes effectively
### Layer No.4: Processes

- The goal here is to understand these factors and identify the dependencies between them
### Layer No.5: Privileges

- These privileges often provide us with functions that administrators overlook. This often happens in Active Directory infrastructures and many other case-specific administration environments and servers where users are responsible for multiple administration areas.

- It is crucial to identify these and understand what is and is not possible with these privileges
### Layer No.6: OS Setup

- The goal here is to see how the administrators manage the systems and what sensitive internal information we can glean from them
